gdm - GNOME Display Manager

=head1 SYNOPSIS

gdm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gdm> is the equivalent of xdm(1x) or wdm(1x), but uses the GNOME
libraries to provide a GNOME look-and-feel. It provides the GNOME
equivalent of a "login:" prompt.

B<gdm> reads F</etc/gdm/custom.conf> for its configuration. For each
local display, gdm starts an X server and runs a minimal GNOME session
including a graphical greeter. If configured so, the main gdm process
also listens for XDMCP requests from remote displays. These requests
can either be direct, causing B<gdm> to start a session on the remote
display, or indirect, causing a chooser to be opened.

When managing a display, B<gdm> attempts to execute
F</etc/gdm/Init/>I<display>, or F</etc/gdm/Init/Default> if that does
not exist. When a user logs in, B<gdm> first attempts
F</etc/gdm/PreSession/>I<display> (or F</etc/gdm/PreSession/Default>),
and then one of the sessions defined in F</usr/share/xsessions>. When 
the session has completed, B<gdm> attempts to run
F</etc/gdm/PostSession/>I<display>, or
F</etc/gdm/PostSession/>I<Default>.

B<gdm> maintains information about the displays it is managing in
F</var/lib/gdm>. This includes xauth information, so this directory
is not readable to normal users.

B<gdm> uses PAM to perform authentication using the config file
F</etc/pam.d/gdm>.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over 4

=item XAUTHORITY

Upon session startup, GDM sets the XAUTHORITY environment variable to a
session-specific file in F</run/gdm>.

Applications and scripts that assume this file is set to F<~/.Xauthority>
will not work. To access the display you need both DISPLAY and
XAUTHORITY variables.
